            <main role="main">
                <p><b>Powerwolf</b>, often stylized as <b>POWERWOLF</b>, is a German power metal band founded in 2003 in Saarbrücken by members of Red Aim. The band consists of vocalist Karsten Brill as "Attila Dorn", lead guitarist Benjamin Buss as "Matthew Greywolf", bassist/rhythm guitarist David Vogt as "Charles Greywolf", keyboardist Christian Jost as "Falk Maria Schlegel" and drummer Roel van Helden. The group uses dark themes and images, musically and lyrically, contrary to traditional power metal music, as well as corpse paint, gothic-tinged compositions and songs about Transylvanian werewolf and vampire legends.</p>

                <p>They released their debut album Return in Bloodred in 2005. Their second album, Lupus Dei, was released in 2007. The band entered the official German charts for the first time in 2009 with their third album Bible of the Beast. Shortly after its release, their first drummer Stefan Gemballa (stage name Stéfane Funèbre) left the band. He was replaced by Tom Diener, who was replaced in 2011 by Roel van Helden. In the same year, the band released their fourth album Blood of the Saints. In 2012, Powerwolf signed with Napalm Records and released Preachers of the Night in 2013. It has debuted at No. 1 in Germany. Their sixth album Blessed & Possessed, released in 2015, was certified gold in the Czech Republic. Their seventh album The Sacrament of Sin was released on 20 July 2018, charting well internationally.</p>
                
                <p>Powerwolf has embarked on several tours, with a majority of their tour dates taking place inside of Europe. They also change their costumes for every album.</p>
                
                <p>Most of Powerwolf's albums were well received by fans and critics alike. The music is composed by the entire band, and the lyrics, written mostly by Matthew Greywolf, are inspired by Christianity and ancient Romanian legends. Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as werewolves, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as "The Wolves".</p>

            <article>
                <p>Powerwolf was formed in 2003 by the members of the stoner rock band Red Aim.[1] When the band was founded, the members decided to take on pseudonyms and build up backstories around those.[2]</p>

                <p>Officially, the brothers Charles and Matthew Greywolf had been playing together for years when they decided to create a band, and so Powerwolf was started. Soon the brothers added German drummer Stéfane Funèbre and German keyboardist Falk Maria Schlegel to the band, but could not find a suitable singer to complete the line-up. In the meantime, the band started writing, and on holidays in Romania, Charles and Matthew met Attila Dorn in a pub in Sighișoara and invited him to join their band.[3] Dorn, a student of classical opera at the National University of Music in Bucharest,[4] moved to the band's hometown Saarbrücken, and became the frontman of Powerwolf. With Dorn's love of Romanian werewolf legends, the band created their debut album, Return in Bloodred, which used these same legends as the basis for many of the lyrics. After the album's release, Powerwolf went on their first tour titled Europe in Bloodred Tour.[5]</p>

                <figcaption><i>Powerwolf have used their logo (top) since the release of Preachers of the Night in 2013 and their typeface since the start of their discography</i></figcaption>

                <p>In 2007, they followed up with their second album, Lupus Dei, a concept album starring a wolf as the main character and his rise from bloodlust to enlightenment.[6][7] Powerwolf supported Grave Digger during their tour.[8]</p>
                
                <p>In 2008, Powerwolf released their first video album The Wacken Worship. It contained live footage of their show at Wacken Open Air 2008.[9] In the same year, they went on a Metal is our Mission Tour together with Brainstorm and Pagan's Mind.[10]</p>
                
                <p>The single "Raise Your Fist, Evangelist" was released on 19 March 2009.[11] Powerwolf's third album Bible of the Beast was released on 25 April 2009. The record was able to place as the band's first album in the German charts and reached number 76.[12] They embarked on a tour supporting the album in 2010.[13] "Raise Your Fist, Evangelist" was nominated for the Metal Hammer "Metal Anthem 2010" award.[14]</p>

                <p>On 2 March 2010 Stéfane Funèbre left the band and was replaced by Tom Diener. Powerwolf announced it on their Myspace blog.[15] In November 2010, Powerwolf organist Falk Maria Schlegel stated about the group's new material:[16]</p>

                <blockquote>We spent the last three months in the rehearsal room working out stuff for the new album. Even though it's still in the making, we can already promise the songs are 100% POWERWOLF, taking off where Bible of the Beast ended. There's furious stuff, there's epic stuff — and all of it is catchy as hell.</blockquote>

                <p>On 28 May 2011 the band announced on their website that Tom Diener was replaced by a new drummer Roel van Helden from Netherlands.[17]</p>

                <p>The band released the single "Sanctified With Dynamite" on 24 May 2011 and the second one on 5 July 2011 titled "We Drink Your Blood", to which Powerwolf recorded their first ever music video. It was shot in an ancient monastery church. Falk Maria Schlegel commented that "Shooting the video in such a special and atmospheric place was incredible. The combination of the sacral interior of the church, including altar, confessional box and a church organ with a lot of fire, fog and metal insanity was the perfect set for a Powerwolf video."</p>

                <p>Their fourth album, titled Blood of the Saints, was released on 29 July 2011 in Europe and August 2 in the United States.</p>
                
                <p>In September 2011, Powerwolf went on a quadruple headline tour with Sabaton, Grave Digger and Skull Fist.[18]</p>

                <p><b>*There's a media file here that I'm lost on how to add*</b></p>
                <p>Powerwolf's sound has primarily been described as power metal[48][49][50] and traditional heavy metal,[51][52]</p>

                <p>Powerwolf's musical style is different from other power metal bands.[53] In addition to the classic metal instruments, organ sounds are used. For the studio albums a church choir was recorded.[54] The band states that their main influences are Black Sabbath, Mercyful Fate, Forbidden and Iron Maiden.[55]</p>

                <p>The dominant language of the lyrics is English, but they also use Latin ("Werewolves of Armenia", "Lupus Dei", "Kreuzfeuer", "Stossgebet"), and rarely German ("Moscow After Dark", "We Take the Church by Storm", "Werewolves of Armenia", "Kreuzfeuer", "Amen & Attack", "Stossgebet"). The lyrics of the band are characterized by the treatment of Christianity and ancient Romanian legends. Powerwolf, however, do not consider themselves a religious band, but rather call themselves spiritual.[56] When asked if he was a Christian or a Satanist, Matthew Greywolf answered: "I am a metalist, a metal fan. Metal is my religion. Look at all these people, what unites them? I can tell you, it's the fucking metal."[57] In one of the interviews, Matthew is quoted saying:[57]</p> 
                
                <blockquote>Some people are confused because we never make a point of saying the silly words of which side we are on. A lot of people ask us, "Are you Satanists? Are you Christians?" And we never say anything about that, and we never will, because in what we do in Powerwolf, it’s not important what we as individuals believe or stand for. We sometimes describe religious history, we sometimes write about Satanism, Catholicism, or whatever, but we never judge anything. I think on one side, this is confusing people, but on the other side, a lot of people do understand that we only describe or write lyrics about something, not to deliver a message.</blockquote>

                Audience engagement, and pyrotechnics are important parts of Powerwolf's stage show.[58][59] The vocalist Attila Dorn often speaks directly to the audience and engages them in various activities, such as singing or shouting, before announcing the next song.[60] The band calls their concerts a "heavy metal mass".[61] Their stage setup was designed by Matthew Greywolf.[53]
